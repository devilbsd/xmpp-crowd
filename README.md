xmpp-crowd
==========

This is just a bunch of bots based on the great [SleekXMPP][1] python library,
which are running on my system to make my life a little bit easier. Some of
these will not be of any use for the broader public, especially as they're
missing docstrings (*ahem*), but if anyone can get any interest out of them,
it's fine.

`hub.py`
--------

`hub.py` is in fact the core of the “modern” bots (i.e. all but `foobot.py`),
which abstracts away some of the (very little) boilerplate all bots share.
